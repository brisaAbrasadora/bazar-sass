This is a SASS project made in my course in Web Application Development, for the Interfaces class.

## Goal to achieve
The objective was to understand how SASS works and experiment with it. To do this, we had to create a template for an online store with different sections (in my case, I only created the homepage, the search page, the product detail page, and the order placement page).

## How did I do it
The idea was to recreate an online shop for someone that lives within the Breath of the Wild universe.

To carry out the project, I decided to study how Bootstrap's grid system works and created my own sort of class library to structure the design of the entire website. It was quite interesting, and I learned a lot. Additionally, it is responsive (as best as I could make it). I was satisfied with the result, considering the estimated time for the project.

To view the project correctly, it is necessary to install the Vite and SASS dependencies
